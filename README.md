# Spring '83 keygen [![Build Status](https://github.com/brandur/spring83-keygen/workflows/spring83-keygen%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brandur/spring83-keygen/actions)

This was a simple key generator for Spring '83, but has been superseded by [neospring](https://github.com/brandur/neospring). You can now do this instead:

    $ go install github.com/brandur/neospring@latest
    $ neospring keygen
